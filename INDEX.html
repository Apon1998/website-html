                        The department of Computer Science and Engineering, abbreviated CSE, is offering an
                        undergraduate engineering degree program since the establishment of the university in the year
                        1995 with a view to offer quality higher education to numerous worthy young fellows as well as
                        to meet the huge demand of highly qualified specialists in the field. The program follows an
                        intensive course curriculum containing well-organized courses on basic sciences, computer
                        science, electrical and electronic engineering, computer engineering, management and humanities.
                        Computer science and engineering courses constitute the bulk of the program (about 70%) and are
                        most emphasized, of course.
                        Usual intake of students in the department is twice in an year. Students graduated from this

                        A good number of our graduates have completed postgraduate programs including doctoral programs
                        with brilliant performances at highly ranked universities around the world.
                        The department has a good number of young full-time faculty members with best available exposure
                        to ever-growing horizon of computer science and engineering. Besides, a number of part-time
                        faculties also teach in each semester from other universities, research organizations and
                        industrial establishments for extending experience-rich education.
